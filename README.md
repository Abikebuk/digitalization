* The animation will always have the size of the word and replace the space of the word that have yet not been print. 
* Speed of animation is customizable.
* Multiples modes : 
    * linear : Random characters are print on the next word's character's place to be print. 
    * linear_full : Randoms characters are print on each word's character that have not been print yet.
    * countdown : A number will be print on the next word's characters to be print.
    * countdown_right : A number will be print at the place of the rightest characters of the word.
